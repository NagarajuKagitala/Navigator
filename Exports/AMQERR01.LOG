'Installation1' (C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ) set as the primary installation. You
must restart the operating system to complete the update.

EXPLANATION:
All tasks required to set installation 'Installation1' as the primary
installation have been completed. If the installation was not already set as
the primary installation then the Installation Configuration has also been
updated to identify installation 'Installation1' as the primary installation. 

In order to ensure that the updates are visible machine-wide, a restart of the
operating system is required.
ACTION:
None.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'DESKTOP-9QJNAOQ (127.0.0.1) (6633)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'DESKTOP-9QJNAOQ
(127.0.0.1) (6633)' for channel SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN was not successful. However
the error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully
allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
10061 (X'274D'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach
the destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at
host 'DESKTOP-9QJNAOQ (127.0.0.1) (6633)' was not running.  If this is the
case, perform the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program,
and try again.
